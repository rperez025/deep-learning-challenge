# Module 21 - Neural Networks and Deep Learning

## Neural Network Model Report

### Overview:

The purpose of this analysis is to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by the nonprofit foudnation, Alphabet Soup. I obtained the "charity_data.csv" dataset from the Alphabet Soup business team. 

The dataset included the following columns:

* EIN and NAME—Identification columns
* APPLICATION_TYPE—Alphabet Soup application type
* AFFILIATION—Affiliated sector of industry
* CLASSIFICATION—Government organization classification
* USE_CASE—Use case for funding
* ORGANIZATION—Organization type
* STATUS—Active status
* INCOME_AMT—Income classification
* SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS—Special considerations for application
* ASK_AMT—Funding amount requested
* IS_SUCCESSFUL—Was the money used effectively

### Results: 
Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions:

* **Data Preprocessing**
  - What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
  - What variable(s) are the features for your model?
  - What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?

* **Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model**
  - How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
  - Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
  - What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?

### Summary: 
Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and then explain your recommendation.
